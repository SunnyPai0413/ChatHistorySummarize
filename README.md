# ChatHistorySummarize
A project to summarize chat histories into documents.  
It is supporting WeChat now, maybe QQ and Telegram in later days.

## Functions:
- Sync and export WeChat chat history (Developing)
~~Split text files exported from Memotrace: <https://github.com/LC044/WeChatMsg/>  ~~
Because wanted to reduce the deploying troubles, the project will use Docker-Wine-WeChat instead of WeChat for Windows.
WeChaty bot will be added when the project is done to reduce the resource usage.

- Upload text splits to Kimi AI and generate summaries (Developing)  
- Use tect2vec to count the relations of the contents (Planned)
- Generate documents and export to a database (Scheduled)

## Ps:
This is SunnyPai's first project and I am a beginner at programming. If you have any further suggestions, please post an issue. Thank you for your support and cooperation!
